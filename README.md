# BibCreator
The goal of this program is to read through the content of several .bib files, and create bibliography in IEEE, ACM, and NJ academic styles. 
## How to use
To begin with, the program will need to read through some .bib files containing relevant information for the completion of a bibliography such as the author, date published, etc. In this case, 10 .bib files are given with the names "Latex?.bib" with "?" being the number, ranging from 1 to 10. Once the program is executed, it will check for errors in the given input files, and discard their result if they contain errors. Finally, it will create different JSON files with their respective academic style (either IEEE, ACM, or NJ).
