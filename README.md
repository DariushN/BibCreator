# BibCreator
The goal of this program is to read through the content of several .bib files, and create bibliography in IEEE, ACM, and NJ academic styles. To begin with, the program will need to read through some .bib files containing relevant information for the completion of a bibliography such as the author, date published, etc. In this case, 10 .bib files are given with the names "Latex?.bib" with "?" being the number, ranging from 1 to 10. Once the program is executed, it will check for errors in the given input files, and discard their result if they contain some. Finally, it will create different JSON files with their respective academic style (either IEEE, ACM, or NJ). 
## How to use
1. Create Latex?.bib files by using the ones given in the code as template, and fill all the necessary information
2. Place all the files created at 1) in the same folder as the java file
3. Run the program, and once prompted to input the file, enter the name of the .bib file (ex:Latex1.bib)
## Result
